# resume 

I've been using my LinkedIn profile as a resume for a while which doesn't exactly match a traditional resume. 

Anyway, this is a simple Vite + Preact (Pre-rendered) website that serves my [`resume.json`](/resume.json) file as a professional resume. 

## Creating your own 

Just replace the `resume.json` with your personal creds and achievements and you are done
